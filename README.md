# cpr-documentation-jekyll-jtd

I'm not sure why the theme reverted to not having the table of contents
I removed the docs directory, and it started to build properly.


TODO:

1.  Restructure with CPR documents.
2.  Add gemfile, so we can test this locally (add gemfile.lock to the gitignore).
    Find a way to test this, so I can revert if the Gemfile causes issues with GitHub pages.
