## Introduction

Boxer is a large indoor robotic platform for prototyping and development of industrial and research applications. 
Adapted from the OTTO Motors _OTTO 100 V2.4 autonomous mobile robot (AMR)_, 
Boxer is an industrial-grade mobile robot that is programmable and easily extensible with additional hardware.
The following sections provide key information on safety, setup, operation, and maintenance.

### What's included

Contained in your shipment are the following items:

-   Clearpath Robotics Boxer
-   OTTO 100 Manual Charger
-   Handheld Joystick Controller

### Hardware overview

Below is an overview of the Boxer robot hardware that outlines the key components that you should be aware of in order to get started with using your robot. 

### Software overview

## Safety

The Boxer robot contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the vehicle.

### General warnings

Use of an autonomous robot is inherently dangerous. 
Please take time to locate the red Emergency Stop _(E-stop)_ button on the rear-right of the system. 
When the E-stop button pressed, it provides a secure way to stop the robot movement, but does not control power attached by the attachment panel. 
Ensure the E-stop button is accessible at all times.

When starting out, favor slower wheel speeds. 
Operating at such speeds will allow for more reaction time in the case of unexpected behaviour. 

When the robot is operating, keep clear of the wheels. 

Refer to the [OTTO 100 V2.4 Operation and Maintenance Manual](https://help.ottomotors.com/docs/robots/otto-100-v2-4?preview=/53683025/99909709/OMM-000094-Operation%20and%20Maintenance%20Manual%20OTTO%20100%20V2.4_A.pdf) for further safety precautions when using self-driving vehicles.
